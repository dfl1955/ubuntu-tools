# This script uses a bunch of standing text files to insert an rss entry into 
# an RSS file. It was intially written to create an rss file of my linkedin
# pulse feed. 

# In this case the output file is called linkedin.rss, it is versioned using 
# a version counr file called ctr.txt

# The new snip must be held in item.txt, a standing interim version is held in
# items.xml. This contains the concatenated posts. They are then concatenated
# with head.xml and tail.xml into the new feed file. 

# is item.txt already in items.xml

four=4
#if [ $( diff item.txt | egrep '^<' | wc -l ) != $four ];then
	#echo "Error: diff item* ext fails"
	#exit 10
#fi
# a test on the age of item.txt would be good to.

# if not, back up the rss file and merge the *.xml files into a new rss

mv items.xml items.txt
cat item.txt items.txt > items.xml
rm items.txt

version=$( expr `cat ctr.txt` + 1 )
echo $version > ctr.txt
# linkedin.rss is the name of the new and old feed
cp linkedin.rss linkedin.rss.${version}
cat *.xml > linkedin.rss
